# Tales from the Crypto

My name is Oscar Lopez, Iâ€™m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Course.

In this activity, I was asked to apply natural language processing to understand the sentiment on the latest news highlighting Bitcoin and Ethereum. I had to use fundamental NLP techniques to better understand different factors that involve common words, phrases, organizations and entities mentioned in the articles. 

I used the newsapi to pull the latest articles on both coins and created a DataFrame of sentiment for each, with the information pulled I had to answer some questions referring to the highest mean, highest negative and highest positive between the two coins. Then I had to use NLTK to tokenize text, find n-gram and create word clouds for both coins. Lastly, I had to build a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.

In this assignment, I used class activities, I had to watch class videos and get help from professors before and after class complete the started code to overcome the several challenges I had while coding.
